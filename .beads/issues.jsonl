{"id":"xhtml-test-c1f","title":"Favicon Handling Plan","description":"## Overview\n\nPlan and implement comprehensive favicon validation for the xhtml-test project. Modern favicon requirements have evolved significantly - browsers now support SVG favicons with dark mode, PWAs need specific icon sizes, and Apple devices require touch icons.\n\n## Research Summary\n\n### Modern Favicon Requirements (2025)\n\nPer [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) and other sources, the minimalist modern approach needs just 5 files + manifest:\n\n1. **favicon.ico** (32×32) - Legacy browser fallback\n2. **icon.svg** - Scalable, supports dark mode via CSS media queries\n3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180×180) - iOS home screen\n4. **icon-192.png** (192×192) - Android/Chrome\n5. **icon-512.png** (512×512) - PWA splash screens\n6. **manifest.webmanifest** - PWA icon definitions\n\n### Required HTML Markup\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" sizes=\"32x32\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/icon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.webmanifest\"\u003e\n```\n\n### Dark Mode Support (SVG)\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" \n      media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon-dark.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" \n      media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\u003e\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Favicon Checker Script (`scripts/favicon-check.js`)\n\nValidates:\n- Presence of required favicon link elements in HTML\n- Favicon files exist on filesystem (ico, svg, png)\n- Apple touch icon present for iOS\n- Manifest file exists and contains icon definitions\n- Icon dimensions are correct (using sharp)\n- SVG favicon contains dark mode media query (optional/recommended)\n- No CDN/external favicon URLs (local only, matching project philosophy)\n\nExit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = errors found\n\n### 2. Favicon Skill (`.claude/skills/favicon/`)\n\nGuide Claude on:\n- Modern favicon file requirements\n- Correct HTML link element markup\n- Manifest.webmanifest icon definitions\n- Dark mode SVG techniques\n- Maskable icon safe zone (409×409 centered in 512×512)\n- File naming conventions\n\n### 3. Metadata Profile Updates\n\nExtend `.claude/skills/metadata/profiles/default.json`:\n- Add favicon link elements to recommended section\n- Add apple-touch-icon to recommended\n- Add manifest link to recommended (for PWAs)\n\n### 4. Test Fixtures\n\nCreate test fixtures:\n- `test/fixtures/valid/favicon/complete.html` - All required favicons\n- `test/fixtures/valid/favicon/minimal.html` - Just ico fallback\n- `test/fixtures/invalid/favicon/missing-apple.html` - No touch icon\n- `test/fixtures/invalid/favicon/no-favicon.html` - Missing entirely\n\n### 5. npm Script\n\nAdd to package.json:\n```json\n\"lint:favicon\": \"node scripts/favicon-check.js\"\n```\n\n## Validation Checks\n\n| Check | Severity | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| favicon.ico exists | Error | Legacy browser support |\n| icon.svg exists | Warning | Modern browser scalable icon |\n| apple-touch-icon.png exists | Warning | iOS home screen |\n| manifest.webmanifest exists | Warning | PWA support |\n| Icon dimensions correct | Error | 32x32 ico, 180x180 apple, etc |\n| No external URLs | Error | All favicons must be local |\n| SVG dark mode | Info | Recommended for theme support |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `sharp` - Already in project for image dimension checking\n- No new dependencies required\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Integrates with existing metadata-check.js patterns\n- Similar structure to web-vitals-check.js and image-check.js\n- Follows project philosophy: local dependencies only, no CDN\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs\n- https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest\n- https://maskable.app - Maskable icon validator\n- https://realfavicongenerator.net - Favicon generator","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-18T18:01:22.050772-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T09:19:45.84599-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T09:19:45.84599-08:00","close_reason":"Consolidated into site-check.js implementation (xhtml-test-kdx research)"}
