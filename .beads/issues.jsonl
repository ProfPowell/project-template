The issue can be trivial to prove the point.  Once the agent can do it a human test should happen.  Create a uat-\u003cname of concept\u003e.md file with instructions for the user to follow.  We should add a skill like /uat approve and /uat deny likely with feature or concept names so that Claude can know that a feature is full done or not.
