{"id":"xhtml-test-c1f","title":"Favicon Handling Plan","description":"## Overview\n\nPlan and implement comprehensive favicon validation for the xhtml-test project. Modern favicon requirements have evolved significantly - browsers now support SVG favicons with dark mode, PWAs need specific icon sizes, and Apple devices require touch icons.\n\n## Research Summary\n\n### Modern Favicon Requirements (2025)\n\nPer [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) and other sources, the minimalist modern approach needs just 5 files + manifest:\n\n1. **favicon.ico** (32×32) - Legacy browser fallback\n2. **icon.svg** - Scalable, supports dark mode via CSS media queries\n3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180×180) - iOS home screen\n4. **icon-192.png** (192×192) - Android/Chrome\n5. **icon-512.png** (512×512) - PWA splash screens\n6. **manifest.webmanifest** - PWA icon definitions\n\n### Required HTML Markup\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" sizes=\"32x32\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/icon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.webmanifest\"\u003e\n```\n\n### Dark Mode Support (SVG)\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" \n      media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\"\u003e\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon-dark.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" \n      media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\u003e\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Favicon Checker Script (`scripts/favicon-check.js`)\n\nValidates:\n- Presence of required favicon link elements in HTML\n- Favicon files exist on filesystem (ico, svg, png)\n- Apple touch icon present for iOS\n- Manifest file exists and contains icon definitions\n- Icon dimensions are correct (using sharp)\n- SVG favicon contains dark mode media query (optional/recommended)\n- No CDN/external favicon URLs (local only, matching project philosophy)\n\nExit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = errors found\n\n### 2. Favicon Skill (`.claude/skills/favicon/`)\n\nGuide Claude on:\n- Modern favicon file requirements\n- Correct HTML link element markup\n- Manifest.webmanifest icon definitions\n- Dark mode SVG techniques\n- Maskable icon safe zone (409×409 centered in 512×512)\n- File naming conventions\n\n### 3. Metadata Profile Updates\n\nExtend `.claude/skills/metadata/profiles/default.json`:\n- Add favicon link elements to recommended section\n- Add apple-touch-icon to recommended\n- Add manifest link to recommended (for PWAs)\n\n### 4. Test Fixtures\n\nCreate test fixtures:\n- `test/fixtures/valid/favicon/complete.html` - All required favicons\n- `test/fixtures/valid/favicon/minimal.html` - Just ico fallback\n- `test/fixtures/invalid/favicon/missing-apple.html` - No touch icon\n- `test/fixtures/invalid/favicon/no-favicon.html` - Missing entirely\n\n### 5. npm Script\n\nAdd to package.json:\n```json\n\"lint:favicon\": \"node scripts/favicon-check.js\"\n```\n\n## Validation Checks\n\n| Check | Severity | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| favicon.ico exists | Error | Legacy browser support |\n| icon.svg exists | Warning | Modern browser scalable icon |\n| apple-touch-icon.png exists | Warning | iOS home screen |\n| manifest.webmanifest exists | Warning | PWA support |\n| Icon dimensions correct | Error | 32x32 ico, 180x180 apple, etc |\n| No external URLs | Error | All favicons must be local |\n| SVG dark mode | Info | Recommended for theme support |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `sharp` - Already in project for image dimension checking\n- No new dependencies required\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Integrates with existing metadata-check.js patterns\n- Similar structure to web-vitals-check.js and image-check.js\n- Follows project philosophy: local dependencies only, no CDN\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs\n- https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest\n- https://maskable.app - Maskable icon validator\n- https://realfavicongenerator.net - Favicon generator","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-18T18:01:22.050772-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T09:19:45.84599-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T09:19:45.84599-08:00","close_reason":"Consolidated into site-check.js implementation (xhtml-test-kdx research)"}

Create unified `site-check.js` instead.\n\n**Reasons**:\n1. webhint has deprecated dependencies and maintenance concerns\n2. webhint lacks robots.txt, 404, LLM support, content quality checks\n3. webhint errors on local files (jsdom canvas issues)\n4. Our current 13 scripts already cover most needs\n\n**Proposed Solution**: Create `scripts/site-check.js` that consolidates:\n- Favicon validation (ico, svg, apple, manifest icons)\n- robots.txt validation\n- sitemap.xml validation\n- manifest.webmanifest validation\n- 404 page detection\n- llms.txt (LLM/AI crawler support)\n\nThis replaces the individual planning beads (xhtml-test-c1f, xhtml-test-mfl, xhtml-test-ry3, xhtml-test-e8l) with a single consolidated implementation.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T08:54:05.108383-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T09:20:16.685858-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T09:20:16.685858-08:00","close_reason":"Research complete - see webhint-exploration.md.

Generate scaffold with configurable site name, description, author\n2. Include proper meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards in base HTML\n3. Favicon set with all required sizes\n4. CSS with design tokens and @layer structure\n5. robots.txt with sensible defaults\n6. sitemap.xml template\n7. 404/500 error pages with consistent styling\n\n## JavaScript Stub\nThe main.js should include:\n- Init function triggered by DOMContentLoaded\n- Module pattern or ES modules structure\n- Progressive enhancement approach (site works without JS)\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init);\n\nfunction init() {\n  // Site initialization\n}\n```\n\n## Future Expansion\n- SSG variant for Astro\n- SSG variant for 11ty\n- Separate boilerplate repos\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Skill file created at .claude/skills/site-scaffold/SKILL.md\n- [ ] Scaffold includes all standard files\n- [ ] JS stub has init function with DOMContentLoaded listener\n- [ ] Generated HTML passes all project validation\n- [ ] Can be invoked to scaffold a new site directory","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T19:20:58.568411-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T20:08:42.871929-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T20:08:42.871929-08:00","close_reason":"Site scaffold skill implemented with 15 template files"}
