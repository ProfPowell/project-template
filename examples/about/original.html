<h1>About DemoCompany</h1>

<div class="intro">
<p>For over seven decades, DemoCompany has been a leader in widget innovation. What started as a small family workshop in Upper Fake, Wisconsin has grown into a publicly traded company serving customers worldwide.</p>
</div>

<div class="history">
<h4>Our History</h4>
<p>DemoCompany was founded in 1952 by Harold Winkleberry, a mechanical engineer with a vision for better widgets. Operating out of his garage on Boogie Woogie Avenue, Harold crafted each widget by hand, earning a reputation for quality that would define the company for generations.</p>

<p>In 1975, Harold's son, George Winkleberry Jr., took over operations and expanded the product line to include gadgets. The 1980s saw rapid growth as DemoCompany became the go-to supplier for manufacturing companies across the Midwest.</p>

<p>The third generation, George Winkleberry III, introduced thingamajigs in 1998 and opened the company's first international office. Under his leadership, DemoCompany became a household name.</p>

<p>Today, George Winkleberry IV leads DemoCompany as CEO. In 2020, he made the historic decision to take the company public, honoring the family legacy while positioning DemoCompany for its next chapter of growth.</p>
